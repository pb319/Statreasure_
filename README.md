- `Bootstrapping` is used to create the `Sampling Distribution`, which represents the distribution of a sample statistic from multiple samples taken from the same population.
- Here we used the sample mean as the statistic, eventually depicting the `Central Limit Theorem`.
- Thus it connects the `Student's t` that was published in 1908 in `Biometrica` by `W.S.Gosset` to answer the question "What is the sampling distribution of the mean of a sample, drawn from a larger population??".
- W.S.Gosset started out the resampling experiment - by drawing random `samples of size 4` from a data set of 3000 measurements and plotted Z-scores along the X-axis and frequency along the Y-axis.
